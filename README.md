# Calmify: Reflect, Relax, and Understand Your Emotions

With the hustle and bustle of our hectic lives, finding time for self-reflection can be challenging. Calmify is designed to provide users with a comforting space for reflection and understanding of their emotions. Inspired by the power of journaling, Calmify goes a step further by offering prompts and questions to guide users in expressing their thoughts and feelings.

## What Calmify Does

Calmify is an app that encourages users to engage in meaningful reflection and emotional understanding. Meet Calmify's mascot, the serene cat, guiding you through your reflective journey. The app prompts users with thought-provoking questions about their day, serving as a starting point for reflection. The unique feature of summarizing user responses into a short blurb helps users contextualize and reflect on their day and emotions.

## How We Built Calmify

### Back-End
The back-end of Calmify was developed using Node.js libraries and integrated with the Co:here API. Co:here plays a crucial role in collecting user-inputted data and summarizing it. Leveraging Co:here's classify functionality, the app conducts sentiment analysis on user inputs, providing insights into the general emotions expressed.

### Front-End
The front-end of Calmify was crafted with React Native, incorporating UX designs from Figma. Express.js serves as middleware, ensuring seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.

## Future Development

Calmify is an evolving project, and we are committed to enhancing the user experience. Here are some features we plan to implement in the future:

1. **User Authentication and Login System:**
   - Enable users to access Calmify across various platforms and devices.

2. **Voice-to-Text Functionality:**
   - Improve app accessibility with voice-to-text functionality for the chat journaling feature.

3. **Expanded Archive Functions:**
   - Allow users to explore their journal entries and emotions beyond the current week, providing a more extensive view of their reflective journey.
